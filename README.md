## üöÄ Installation

```bash
npm install nestjs-fauna
```

## ü§ñ Getting Started

Before you start using this package, you need to have a FaunaDB account and a database set up. If you haven't already done this, head over to the [FaunaDB website](https://fauna.com/) and follow their instructions to get started.

Once you have your FaunaDB credentials, you can configure the package in your NestJS application.

### Configuration

In your NestJS application, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your FaunaDB secret key:

```dotenv
FAUNADB_SECRET_KEY = your_faunadb_secret_key_here
```

Make sure to load the `.env` file using a package like `dotenv` in your application's main entry file (e.g., `main.ts`).

### Module Registration

Register the FaunaDB module in your NestJS application. Import the `FaunaModule` and pass in the configuration options:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { FaunaModule } from 'nestjs-fauna'

@Module({
  imports: [
    FaunaModule.forRoot({
      secret: process.env.FAUNADB_SECRET_KEY,
      // Other options if needed
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## üèÄ Usage

With the FaunaDB module configured, you can now inject the `FaunaService` into your services or controllers to interact with the FaunaDB client.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { FaunaService, Collection, Ref, Get } from 'nestjs-fauna'

@Injectable()
export class MyService {
  constructor(private readonly faunaService: FaunaService) {}

  async getDocumentById(id: string): Promise<any> {
    return this.faunaService.query(Get(Ref(Collection('my_collection'), id)))
  }

  // Add more methods to interact with FaunaDB as needed
}
```

In the example above, we use the `FaunaService.query` method to execute a query against the FaunaDB client. You can leverage FaunaDB's powerful query language to perform various operations on your collections and documents.

For more information on the available query functions and how to use them, refer to the [FaunaDB documentation](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/start/cloud).

## ‚úÖ Features

- Seamless integration with NestJS applications.
- Easy-to-use API for interacting with FaunaDB.
- Utilizes FaunaDB's powerful query language for flexible database operations.
- Configurable and supports multiple environments using environment variables.
